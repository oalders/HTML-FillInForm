    - Fix incorrectly multiple escaped data in list context (#34081 Miika
      Pekkarinen)

    - Allow FIF to process the new <input> field  types (URL, email, and
      number) as defined in the HTML5 draft and already implemented by the
      iPhone.  (Michael Fisher)

    - Allow alternate parsing class (Mark Stosberg)

    - mark invalid fields (Sam Tregar)

2.0 - September 11th, 2007

    - Allow passing an arrayref of hashrefs through fdat (Mark Stosberg,
      Michael Graham)

    - Several new shortcuts: (Mark Stosberg)
        Allow calling fill() as a class method as a shortcut.
        Allow   \$html  as shortcut for   scalarref => \$html
        Allow   \@html  as shortcut for   arrayref  => \@html
        Allow   \*html  as shortcut for   file      => \*html
        Allow   'html'  as shortcut for   file      => 'html'
        Allow   $q      as shortcut for   fobject   => $q
        Allow  \%fdat   as shortcut for   fdat      => \%fdat

        In summary, instead of this:

        my $fif = HTML::FillInForm->new;
        $fif->fill( scalarref => \$html, fdat => \%data );

        You can simply write:

        HTML::FillInForm->fill( \$html, \%data );
